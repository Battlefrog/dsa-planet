# ðŸŒŽ [Planet DSA](https://planet.dsausa.org)

Planet DSA is a web feed aggregator forked from [Planet openSUSE](https://planet.opensuse.org) that collects blog posts from various DSA chapters across the country, national working groups and committees, and our publications. 

## Adding your feed
If you want to get your website added, we need your webpage to have an RSS feed. TBD for how to contribute -- Github form?
